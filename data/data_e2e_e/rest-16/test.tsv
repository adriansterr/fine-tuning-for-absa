402	On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)', '(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""eggs"")', '(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""meal"")']"
403	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""dish"")']"
404	To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""manager"")']"
405	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).

407	– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""Ray\'s Boathouse"")']"
408	Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""Sound views"")']"
409	Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!	['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)', '(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""views"")', '(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""Ray\'s"")']"
410	To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""Brooke"")']"
411	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.

412	For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)', '(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, ""seared Alaskan sea scallops"")', '(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE, ""seared Alaskan sea scallops"")']"
413	The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)', '(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, ""scallops"")', '(FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, POSITIVE, ""scallops"")']"
414	My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.

415	I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, ""plate"")']"
416	Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)', '(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEUTRAL)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""server"")', '(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEUTRAL, ""Ray\'s"")']"
417	All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.	['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""Ray\'s Boathouse"")']"
418	While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)', '(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""server"")', '(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, ""food"")']"
419	Oh yeah...the view was good, too.	['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(LOCATION#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""view"")']"
