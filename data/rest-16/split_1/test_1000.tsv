1494	I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).

1537	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.

1621	Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan	['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""Restaurant"")']"
1624	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.	['(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEGATIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
