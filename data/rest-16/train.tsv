352	It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""NULL"")']"
353	They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.	['(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, POSITIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS, POSITIVE, ""NULL"")']"

355	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!	['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE)']	"['(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, POSITIVE, ""NULL"")']"
356	First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.	['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""place"")']"
357	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.	['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(AMBIENCE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
358	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.

360	Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""Service"")']"
361	For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
362	Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""service"")']"
363	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE)', '(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, POSITIVE, ""food"")', '(RESTAURANT#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""Teodora"")']"
364	Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)', '(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""meals"")', '(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""rosemary or orange flavoring"")']"
365	Fish was overdone.	['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE)']	"['(FOOD#QUALITY, NEGATIVE, ""Fish"")']"

1702	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""waiter"")']"
1703	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
1704	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""waitress"")']"
1705	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
1706	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE)']	"['(SERVICE#GENERAL, NEGATIVE, ""NULL"")']"
